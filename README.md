## Features

- Each instance continuously and automatically resets until a good spawn is found.
- The player will automatically be switched to the instance with the best spawn.
- Any instance not being played or resetted can be suspended automatically to use no processing resources, with the option to free memory.
- Custom affinity can be set for playing versus background instances for performance.
- Compatible with Fast Reset mod
- Compatible with WorldPreview mod
- v1.2 and beyond are compatible with and require [atum] (legal as of February 4, 2022)
- The "goodness" of a spawn is judged off of its distance to a user-defined centerpoint.
- The player can set their own whitelist and/or blacklist to supplement the centerpoint+radius resetting.
- Scenes in OBS are automatically switched.
- Track flint rates and attempts
- Perch hotkey and villager killer hotkey
- Move speedrun worlds into an oldWorlds folder
